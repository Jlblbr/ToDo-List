#ToDo List App#

In the project, we will be creating a Complete Todo Application with all features. We will do all the CRUD operations. We will use `React.js` and to manage our states, we will use `Redux`. Also we will learn to make simple animations using `Framer Motion`. This will be a complete `beginner` friendly app. Hope you enjoy it.

#Viewing Your React App On Another Device#
Once you have both the number after localhost from your URL and your local IP Address, you are ready to go to your other device. Simply pull up your deviceâ€™s browser and type in the IPv4 Address you copied down earlier followed by a colon and then the port number. The format should look something like the following: 555.55.55.555:1234 once you hit enter, you should see your React App live on your mobile device!
